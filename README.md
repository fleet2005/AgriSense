## Features

- **Plant Disease Detection**: Upload a leaf image to detect plant diseases using a custom-trained CNN model (39 classes, including healthy and diseased states for major crops).
- **Disease Outbreak Prediction**: Predict the risk of disease outbreaks based on real-time and historical weather data, crop susceptibility, and regional factors.
- **Crop Recommendation**: Get crop recommendations based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, and moisture using a logistic regression model.
- **Supplement Suggestions**: Receive actionable treatment steps and recommended supplements for detected diseases.
- **Weather Forecast Integration**: Real-time weather data fetching for location-based predictions.
- **Email Notifications**: OTP-based user verification and notification system.
- **Firebase Integration**: Fetch real-time sensor data for soil and environmental parameters.
